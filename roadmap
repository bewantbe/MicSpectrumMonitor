Roadmap
=======

Implemented
-----------

* Introduce and test multi-channels, monitor and recorder
  - done
* write spectrogram show (1 channel then n-cahnnels)
  - done
* refactor spectrogram show to make it independent
  - done
* refactor spectrum plot to make it independent
  - done
* make waveform plot independent
  - done
* Add time-frequency axis to the spectrogram
  - done.
* Add button to save the window as a png file
  - done.
* apply analysis to multi-channels.
  - extend analyzerData to multi-channels: done
  - extend plots
    + done waveform
    + done spectrum
    + done RMS
    + spectrogram -- cancelled
* Add RMS curve plot.
  - done
* Reduce plot margin.
  - done
* Add limit to FPS.
  - done.
* Add sample rate monitor in recthread.
  - done, but not so useful, now commented.
* Allow Log freq axis mode.
  - done spectrum plot.
* Better user interaction design
  - start/stop recording
    + done
  - Show the recording time we saved.
    + done
  - Show possible recording time left.
    + done
* Add units for axis, and get scale prefix, set grid for some plot.
  - done
* longer update time for remaining space for rec.
  - done
* callback to monitoring/stop
  - done
* callback to device
  - refactor audio data pipeline
    + done
  - full restart
    + done
* callback to sampling rate
    + done
* callback to select channels
    + done
* callback to FFT length
    + done
* callback to averaging
    + done
* Test AD7606C
    + done, run but not stable.
* properly close AD7606C
  - done
* More smart frame rate control
  - done, but still do not know where is the slow part in the whole pipeline
  - done, now I know it is the ADC driver's fault that lost track of the sampling ring buffer.
* Move non-directly related files to former_script
  - done
Targets for v0.5
* Map volt 0~5V to -1~1, test save.
  - done
* Remember user settings, across sessions
  - done
* Make waveform plot accept all zero input, instead of let pyqtgraph gives warnings.
  - done, it is not waveform plot's fault, but the spectrogram's imshow.
* re-structure the file layout as an app.
  - done.
* add publish direction, test usage in embed-python.
  - done.
* If save path is a directory, then auto generate a file name.
  - done.
* Make waveform closable.
  - done.

Features under consideration
----------------------------

Target for v0.6 or later

* rework the drop down list.
* rework adc.read(), make it more clear the format of output.
* Able to load calibration file by a button.
* Move ADC parameters to ADC tssampler class.
* Reording tssampler init parameters.
* Rename tssamplers.
* Use true multi-thread (such as Qt thread) for recorder and STFT analyzer.
* Clearn up logging and dbg_print and print.
* Make UI adapt its size automatically (like button size by text length), adapt different DPI.
* Faster recover time for the adaptive fps limiter, or modify its logic.
* Add a time cursor for the spectrogram and RMS
* Allow choose channels for the spectrogram, such as using a button.
* Colormap for spectrogram
* Allow update device list by using/writing tssampler functions.
  - such as sine, white noise.
* Add advanced setting for device parameters.
* Spectrogram plot log mode.
* Add button beside spectrum plot or in the advanced setting to allow user to select normalization mode.
* Optimize spectrogram speed/cpu
* link frequency axis of spectrum and spectrogram?
* Show theory lower bound of spectrum and RMS.
* consider support RF64 format for wav file, e.g.
  - using soundfile, https://pypi.org/project/soundfile/
  - using pysndfile, https://pypi.org/project/pysndfile/, https://forge-2.ircam.fr/roebel/pysndfile
* Add waveform sync (trigger) function, and show frequency in it.
* Add device support for USB oscilloscope.
* Add device support for [Comedi](http://comedi.org/) in Linux.
